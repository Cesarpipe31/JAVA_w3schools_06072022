/*
Java Declare Multiple Variables
Declare Many Variables
To declare more than one variable of the same type, you can use a comma-separated list:

Example
Instead of writing:

int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);
You can simply write:

int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);

One Value to Multiple Variables
You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

Example
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);

Test Yourself With Exercises
Exercise:
Fill in the missing parts to create three variables of the same type, using a comma-separated list:

 x = 5
 y = 6
 z = 50;
